Welcome to Feluda's documentation!
================================

Feluda is a configurable engine for analyzing multi-lingual and multi-modal content.

While flexible, we built it to analyze data collected from social media - images, text, and video.
This forms the core of our search, clustering, and analysis services. Since different use cases
might require different search capabilities with different trade-offs, Feluda lets you specify
which building blocks you want to use for the purpose and spins an engine with a corresponding configuration.
